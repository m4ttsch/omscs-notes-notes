# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took CN in OMSCS during Spring 2019.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud436). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit the lesson intro videos.

## Textbook Information

The following textbooks helped me get an **A** in this course:

- [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://amzn.to/3bTL2o3)
- [Computer Networks](https://amzn.to/3gjF0km)

## Download These Notes

Some students have asked for PDF versions of the notes for a simpler, more portable
studying experience. The following PDFs are available for download.

- [Computer Networks - Complete](https://payhip.com/b/9UGM "The complete set of CN lecture notes, covering content from all sixteen lectures.")
