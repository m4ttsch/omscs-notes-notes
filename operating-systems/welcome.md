# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took GIOS in OMSCS during Fall 2018.

I have organized them into two sections:

* Lecture Notes
* Exam Review

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit the lecture preview, visual metaphor, and lecture review videos.

Each document in "Exam Review" corresponds to a completed list of questions that were provided ahead of the two exams.

## Textbook Information

The following textbooks helped me get an **A** in this course:

* [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](https://amzn.to/36pvc3J)
* [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://amzn.to/2zYwNRV)

## Download These Notes

Some students have asked for PDF versions of the notes for a simpler, more portable studying experience. The following PDFs are available for download.

* [Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems - Complete](https://payhip.com/b/9I1Q)
* [Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems - Lecture Notes](https://payhip.com/b/VJ40)
* [Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems - Exam Review](https://payhip.com/b/BCoS)

## Environment Setup

This class requires some environment setup. I have recorded the following YouTube walkthroughs, which may be helpful:

* [Vagrant/VirtualBox installation on Mac OSX High Sierra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m21YykIAPCA)
* [File transfer from host to VM via Vagrant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDodZdtoK40)
