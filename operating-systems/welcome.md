# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took GIOS in OMSCS during Fall 2018.

I have organized them into two sections:

- Lecture Notes
- Exam Review

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit the lecture preview, visual metaphor, and lecture review videos.

Each document in "Exam Review" corresponds to a completed list of questions that were provided ahead of the two exams.

## Textbook Information

The following textbooks helped me get an **A** in this course:

- [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](https://amzn.to/36pvc3J)
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://amzn.to/2zYwNRV)

## Download These Notes

Some students have asked for PDF versions of the notes for a simpler, more portable
studying experience. The following PDFs are available for download.

- [Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems - Complete](https://payhip.com/b/9I1Q 'The complete set of GIOS notes, including lecture notes and exam review materials.')
- [Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems - Lecture Notes](https://payhip.com/b/VJ40 'The complete set of GIOS lecture notes, covering content from all fifteen lectures.')
- [Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems - Exam Review](https://payhip.com/b/BCoS 'The complete set of GIOS exam review notes, containing study material for the midterm and final exams.')

This class requires some environment setup. I have recorded the following YouTube walkthroughs, which may be helpful:
