# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took GIOS in OMSCS during Fall 2018.

I have organized them into two sections:

* Lecture Notes
* Exam Review

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit the lecture preview, visual metaphor, and lecture review videos.

Each document in "Exam Review" corresponds to a completed list of questions that were provided ahead of the two exams.

There is a lot of information in these documents. I hope you find it helpful!

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or improvements, don't hesitate to reach out to me. You can find me at:
