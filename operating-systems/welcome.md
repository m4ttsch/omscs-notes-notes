# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took GIOS in OMSCS during Fall 2018.

I have organized them into two sections:

* Lecture Notes
* Exam Review

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit the lecture preview, visual metaphor, and lecture review videos.

Each document in "Exam Review" corresponds to a completed list of questions that were provided ahead of the two exams.

## Textbook Information

The following textbooks helped me get an **A** in this course:
- [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](https://amzn.to/2Wgn8Pg)
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://amzn.to/35NiXh6)
  
## Environment Setup

This class requires some environment setup. I have recorded the following YouTube walkthroughs, which may be helpful:

- [Vagrant/VirtualBox installation on Mac OSX High Sierra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m21YykIAPCA)
- [File transfer from host to VM via Vagrant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDodZdtoK40)
- [Bonnie JWT Host Vagrant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ-fX2G5c0c)
