Answer C \*\*Source\*\* Firewalls and Filtering

**True or False?**

Packet filtering at a very high level is essentially a policy that has a set of access control lists based on packet types.

Answer True \*\*Source\*\* Filtering types

**Multiple Choice**

Session filtering is based on the context within a session. In order to do this a firewall maintains a session or connection and performs a **\_\_**.

* A.    Traffic Block
* B.    Stateful inspection
* C.    DMZ re route
* D.    Virtual Switch

Answer B \*\*Source\*\* Filtering types

**True or False?**

In a packet filtering firewall decisions are made on a per packet basis and not other packets.

Answer True \*\*Source\*\* Packet filtering

**True or False?**

The packet filtering firewall applies a list of rules to match the IP or TCP header of a packet and based on the rules match the firewall and then to decide to forward or discard the packet.

Answer True \*\*Source\*\* Packet Filtering Firewall

**Multiple Choice**

IP or TCP header information that a firewall can use to filter a packet • Source IP address where the packets from • Destinations IP address this is the IP for the destination • Source and destination transport-level address- This defines the port number and applications such as smtp, http • IP Protocol field this defines TCP , UDP or ICMP • Interface this is with three or more ports with which interface the packet came or where it is going to.

What policies for packet filtering firewalls are used?

* A.Default Discard Policy
* B. Default forward policy
* C. Default Isolation Policy
* D. Default write down policy
* E. C & B
* F. A & B

Answer F \*\*Source\*\* Packet Filtering Firewall When there is no rule that matches the packet it will be discarded this is safe procedure but also a hindrance to users who see that some traffic isn't allowed. Forward policy is easier to use and manage and use but less secure it just lets all packets in.

**Multiple Choice**

What are the weaknesses to packet filtering?

* A. Limited logging functionality
* B. Vulnerable to attacks that take advantage of TCP/IP
* C. Can't Prevent attacks that employ application specific vulnerabilities or functions

Answer E \*\*Source\*\* Packet Filtering

**Multiple Choice**

Packet Filtering Firewall Countermeasures are all of the following **except**?

* A. IP Address Spoofing
* B. Source Routing Attacks
* C. Tiny Fragment Attack
* D. Stateful inspection Attack

Answer D \*\*Source\*\* Packet filtering firewall countermeasures are A,B,C IP Address Spoofing countermeasures: Discard packets with an inside source address if the packet arrives on an external interface Source Routing Attacks: Discards all packets in which the source destinations specifies to the route Tiny Fragment Attack: Enforcing a rule that the first fragment of a packet must contain a predefined minimum amount of the transport header. In textbook IP address spoofing: The intruder transmits packets from the outside with a source IP address field containing an address of an internal host. The attacker hopes that the use of a spoofed address will allow penetration of systems that employ simple source address security, in which packets from specific trusted internal hosts are accepted. The countermeasure is to discard packets with an inside source address if the packet arrives on an external interface. In fact, this countermeasure is often implemented at the router external to the firewall. Source routing attacks: The source station specifies the route that a packet should take as it crosses the Internet, in the hopes that this will bypass security measures that do not analyze the source routing information. A countermeasure is to discard all packets that use this option. Tiny fragment attacks: The intruder uses the IP fragmentation option to create extremely small fragments and force the TCP header information into a separate packet fragment. This attack is designed to circumvent filtering rules that depend on TCP header information. Typically, a packet filter will make a filtering decision on the first fragment of a packet. All subsequent fragments of that packet are filtered out solely on the basis that they are part of the packet whose first fragment was rejected. The attacker hopes the filtering firewall examines only the first fragment and the remaining fragments are passed through. A tiny fragment attack can be defeated by enforcing a rule that the first fragment of a packet must contain a predefined minimum amount of the transport header. If the first fragment is rejected, the filter can remember the packet and discard all subsequent fragments.

**True or False?**

Firewalls can only be one single computer system.

Answer False \*\*Source\*\* Firewalls can be a set of two or more systems \(Page 290\)

**Multiple Choice**

The goals of a firewall are all the following except which?

* A.    All traffic from inside to outside and vice versa must pass through the firewall. This is achieved by physically blocking all access to the local network except via the firewall.
* B.    Only authorized traffic as defined by the local security policy will be allowed to pass.
* C.    Only unauthorized users are defined by the local security policy and will be allowed to pass.
* D.    The firewall is immune to penetration

Answer C \*\*Source\*\* Page 290…. It should also be noted that since the firewall itself is immune to penetration this implies the use of a hardened system with a secured operating system.

**True or False?**

A major component in the planning and implementation of a firewall is specifying an access policy.

Answer True \*\*Source\*\* \(True Page 290 This lists the types of traffic authorized to pass through the firewall, including address ranges, protocols, applications, and content types. This policy should be developed from the organization's information security risk assessment and policy\)

**Multiple Choice**

A firewall access policy would use which of the following to filter traffic?

* A.    IP Address and Protocol values
* B.    Application Protocol
* C.    User Identity
* D.    Network Activity
* E.    All of the Above

Answer E \*\*Source\*\* Page 290-291 IP Address and Protocol Values-This controls access based on the source and destination IP address and port numbers, direction of flow \(either inbound or outbound\). This type of filtering is used with packet filter and stateful inspection firewall designs. This practice is used to limit access to a specific service. Application Protocol- This controls access on the basis of authorized application protocol data. This type of filtering is used by application-level-gateway that relays and monitors the exchange of information for specific application protocols \(for example SMTP, HTTP \(email and web requests\) for authorized users\) User Identity- Controls Access based on user identity typically for inside users who identity themselves use secure authentication such as IPSec Network Activity- Controls the access based on: time or request such as only during businesss hours, rate of request etc.

**Multiple Choice**

The following are all in the scope of a firewall except which?

* A.    Firewalls are a single choke point that attempts to keep unauthorized users out of the network, prohibit potential vulnerable services from entering or leaving the network and provide protection from various kinds of IP spoofing or routing attacks.
* B.    Firewalls provide a location for monitoring security-related events
* C.    Firewalls fully protect against internal threats which include disgruntled employee.
* D.    Firewalls allow for several internet functions that are not security related also to happen such as Network Address Translators and Network management function.
* E.    A firewall can serve as a platform for IPSec. Firewalls can be used to implement VPN's as well

Answer C \*\*Source\*\* this is a limitation of the firewall Page 291 A firewall defines a single choke point that attempts to keep unauthorized users out of the protected network, prohibit potentially vulnerable services from entering or leaving the network, and provide protection from various kinds of IP spoofing and routing attacks. The use of a single choke point simplifies security management because security capabilities are consolidated on a single system or set of systems. A firewall provides a location for monitoring security-related events. Audits and alarms can be implemented on the firewall system. A firewall is a convenient platform for several Internet functions that are not security related. These include a network address translator, which maps local addresses to Internet addresses, and a network management function that audits or logs Internet usage. A firewall can serve as the platform for IPSec. Using the tunnel mode capability described in Chapter 22, the firewall can be used to implement virtual private networks. Firewalls have their limitations, including the following: The firewall cannot protect against attacks that bypass the firewall. Internal systems may have wired or mobile broadband capability to connect to an ISP. An internal LAN may have direct connections to peer organizations that bypass the firewall. The firewall may not protect fully against internal threats, such as a disgruntled employee or an employee who unwittingly cooperates with an external attacker. An improperly secured wireless LAN may be accessed from outside the organization. An internal firewall that separates portions of an enterprise network cannot guard against wireless communications between local systems on different sides of the internal firewall. A laptop, PDA, or portable storage device may be used and infected outside the corporate network, then attached and used internally.

What is the correct order for how an attacker behaves during intrusion:

* A. Maintaining Access this is important because an attack may not be a onetime action they may install backdoors or other malicious software on a target system so they can continue to access.
* B. Information Gathering System Exploit this is when an attacker has already gained sufficient privilege on a system and he or she can find out more about the network and the organization or even move to another target system to further exploit on the network.
* C. Covering Tracks: This is when the user makes sure there is no evidence of them on the system this can be done by disabling or even editing the system audit logs to remove evidence of attack activities. Alternatively, the user can install a root kit to hide the installed malware.
* D. Privilege Escalation this is taken after initial access ad the attacker will try to use a local exploit to escalate its privilege form from normal user to root on target system.
* E. Initial Access this is accomplished by exploiting a remote network vulnerability.
* F. Target acquisition and information gathering this is when the attacker identifies the target system using publicly available information both technical and non-technical and they also use network tools to analyze target resources.

An IDS is comprised of three logical components which of the following is not a component:

* A. Analyzers
* B. User interface
* C. Deep Learning
* D. Sensors

Answer C Deep learning is not part of the IDS logical component the IDS is composed of the following Sensors: Sensors are responsible for collecting data. The input for a sensor may be any part of a system that could contain evidence of an intrusion. Types of input to a sensor includes network packets, log files, and system call traces. Sensors collect and forward this information to the analyzer. Analyzers: Analyzers receive input from one or more sensors or from other analyzers. The analyzer is responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred. The output of this component is an indication that an intrusion has occurred. The output may include evidence supporting the conclusion that an intrusion occurred. The analyzer may provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion. The sensor inputs may also be stored for future analysis and review in a storage or database component. User interface: The user interface to an IDS enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system. In some systems, the user interface may equate to a manager, director, or console component. \*\*Source\*\* Page 256

**Multiple Choice**

In an IDS system the sensors do what?

* A. Determine if an intrusion has occurred

Answer D \*\*Source\*\* PG 256

**True or False?**

Analyzers are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred. The output of this component is an indication that an intrusion has occurred. But the output 100% of the time doesn't include evidence supporting the conclusion that an intrusion has occurred.

Answer False The analyzer output may include evidence supporting the conclusion that an intrusion occurred. The analyzer may provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion. \*\*Source\*\* Page 256

**True or False?**

Intrusion Detection Systems are only allowed to use a single sensor.

Answer False IDS can use multiple sensors across a range of host and network devices sending information to a centralized analyzer and user interface in a distributed architecture. \*\*Source\*\* Page 256

**True or False?**

* B. Network-based IDS is II, Host-Based IDS is I and Distributed IDS is III
* C. Host-Based IDS is III, Network based IDS is I and Host based IDS is I
* D. There are no other IDS architectures just one Host-Based IDS

Answer B Host-based IDS \(HIDS\): Monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that host, such as process identifiers and the system calls they make, for evidence of suspicious activity. Network-based IDS \(NIDS\): Monitors network traffic for particular network segments or devices and analyzes network, transport, and application protocols to identify suspicious activity. Distributed or hybrid IDS: Combines information from a number of sensors, often both host and network-based, in a central analyzer that is able to better identify and respond to intrusion activity. \*\*Source\*\* Page 257

**True or False?**

In the context of IDS systems a false negative is when a authorized user is identified as an intruder and a false positive is identified where intruders are not identified as intruders.

Answer False \*\*Source\*\* &gt; Thus, a loose interpretation of intruder behavior, which will catch more intruders, will also lead to a number of false positives, or false alarms, where authorized users are identified as intruders. On the other hand, an attempt to limit false positives by a tight interpretation of intruder behavior will lead to an increase in false negatives, or intruders not identified as intruders. Thus, there is an element of compromise and art in the practice of intrusion detection. Page 257

**True or False?**

## Chapter 2: Cryptographic Tools

**True or False?**

Symmetric Encryption relies on a public and private key meanwhile asymmetric encryption relies on a shared key between two parties

Answer False \*\*Source\*\* Lectures

**Multiple Choice**

There are two schemes to attack a symmetric encryption scheme. What are they?

* A. Cryptanalysis & Brute-Force attacks
* B. Cryptanalysis & DDoS
* C. Brute-force attack and CipherText
* D. Cryptanalysis & Caesar

Answer A There are two general approaches to attacking a symmetric encryption scheme. The first attack is known as cryptanalysis. Cryptanalytic attacks rely on the nature of the algorithm plus perhaps some knowledge of the general characteristics of the plaintext, or even some sample plaintext-ciphertext pairs. This type of attack exploits the characteristics of the algorithm to attempt to deduce a specific plaintext or to deduce the key being used. If the attack succeeds in deducing the key, the effect is catastrophic: All future and past messages encrypted with that key are compromised. The second method, known as the brute-force attack, is to try every possible key on a piece of ciphertext until an intelligible translation into plaintext is obtained. \*\*Source\*\* Page 32

**True or False?**

* C. The key length of 56 bits and the cryptanalysis of the algorithm
* D. All of the above

Answer C \*\*Source\*\* Page 33

**True or False?**

The main reason most companies go with 3DES is because the algorithm is relatively faster in software compared to normal DES and AES

Using the Pigeonhole Principle, given that a hash can take an input of any size and output a value of fixed size, then it should have collisions.

Answer True \*\*Source\*\* Notes: P2\_L8 - Hashes, pg 5

**True or False?**

The Pigeonhole Principle can be used as a counterexample to the Collision Resistance property of hashes.

Answer False While the Pigeonhole Principle says there exist collisions, the collision resistance property says that it is computationally infeasible to find them. So even though collisions exist, they are hard to find, thus keeping the collision resistance property of hashes intact. \*\*Source\*\* Notes P2\_L8 - Hashes pg 5

**Multiple Choice**

From the birthday "paradox", if the length of the hash is _x_ bits, then a hacker would have to search 2^\(x/2\) messages in order to find a collision. In doing so, what is the probability, approximately, that the hacker will find a collision?

* A. nearly 100%
* B. about 75%
* C. about 66%
* D. about 50%
* E.  about 25%
* F. less than 25%

Answer D The approximate 2^\(n/2\) = sqrt\(2^n\) gives the probability of about 50% that the hacker will find at least 1 match. So it's misleading to say that the hacker would have to search 2^\(n/2\) messages to "find a match". This would only give the hacker better than 50% chance of finding it without some more strategic choices. \*\*Source\*\* Notes P2\_L8 - Hashes pg 4
