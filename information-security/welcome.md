### Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took IIS in OMSCS during Fall 2019.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud459). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit any intro/summary lessons.

There is a lot of information in these documents. I hope you find it helpful!

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or improvements, don't hesitate to reach out to me. You can find me at:
