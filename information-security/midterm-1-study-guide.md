## DAC

Which Type of control is based on the identity of the requestor and the access rules state what a requestor can or cannot do?

* A\) Mandatory Access Control \(MAC\)
* B\) Role-based access control \(RBAC\)
* C\) Discretionary access control \(DAC\)
* D\)Attribute-based access control \(ABAC\)

Answer C. This policy is termed discretionary because an entity might have access rights that permit the entity, by its own volition, to enable another entity to access some resource. Source: Book Chapter 4.2 Page 131

What data structure is typically used to implement DAC?

* A\) Linked List
* B\) 2 Dimensional Matrix
* C\) Red Black Tree
* D\) Stack

Answer B Source: Book Chapter 4.3 Page 111

Access Control Lists make it easy to look up who all the users are that can access a resource, and the type of access they have for that resource.

True or False?

Answer True Source: Book Chapter 4.3 Page 111

Question: What does each entry of an access matrix indicate?

* A. Access rights of a particular object for a particular subject.
* B. Access rights of a particular subject for a particular object.
* C. Access rights of a particular subject for a particular directory.
* D. Access rights of a particular object for a particular group.

Answer B. Source: Book pg. 111

\(True/False\) DAC is a concept that evolved out of requirements for military information security.

Answer False, DAC is the traditional method for implementing access control, MAC was created out of military necessity. Source: Book, Ch 4, Pg. 109

\(True/False\) One problem with DAC is that it is not possible to control information flow.

Answer True Source: Mandatory Access Control Lecture

\(True/False\) DAC is popular with corporations because it reflects how they treat their data.

Answer False. Employers mandate explicit policies on who can share what. Source: Mandatory Access Control Lecture

## Program/Host Privileges -- Program control flow

Put the following statements, regarding the sequence of calls made made by a function call to the stack, in the correct order:

* A. Allocate space for local variables by moving the stack pointer down to leave sufficient room for them.
* B. Push the parameters for the called function onto the stack.
* C. Run the body of the called function.
* D. Execute the return function which pops the saved address off the stack and returns control to the calling function.
* E. Push the current frame pointer value \(which points to the calling routine's stack frame\) onto the stack.
* F. Executes the call instruction to call the target function, which pushes the return address onto the stack.
* G. Pops the old frame pointer value \(restoring the link to the calling routine's stack frame\).
* H. Sets the frame pointer to be the current stack pointer value, which now identifies the new stack frame location for the called function.
* I. Set the stack pointer back to the value of the frame pointer.

Answer B, F, E, H, A, C, I, G, D From text pg 327.

## Access control mechanisms

An access control mechanism mediates between a user \(or a process executing on behalf of a user\) and system resources, such as:

* b\) routers
* c\) applications
* d\) a & b only

* C\) Audit
* D\) Allowance
* E\) None of the Above

Answer B, Authorization determines who is trusted for a given purpose Source: Book Chapter 4.1 Page 130

Question: Access control implements a security policy that verifies the credentials of a user. True or false?

Answer False. Access control implements a security policy that specifies who or what may have access to each specific system resource, and the type of access that is permitted in each instance. Source: Book pg. 107

## MAC

Under Mandatory Access Control\(MAC\), what two properties provide confidentiality:

Answer 1. No read up: A subject can only read an object of less or equal security level 2. No write down: A subject can only write into an object of greater or equal security level. Source: Book Chapter 27 Page 27-4

A subject is said to have a security clearance of a given level and an object is said to have a security classification of a given level.

Answer True Source: Book Chapter 27 Page 27-4

For the Bell-Lapadula Model \(BLP\), the properties needed for the confidentiality form of MAC are:

1. ds-property and \*-property
2. ss-property and \*-property
3. ss-property and ds-property
4. None of the above

Answer 2. \(Chapter 27.1\) ss-property \(simple security property: no read up \\*-property \(star property\): no write down The ds-property is a provision made by BLP for DAC but must be consistent with MAC rules.

Other MAC models such as Bell and La Padua\(BLP Model\) is focused on Integrity, and BIBA model is focused on Confidentiality.

Answer False. BLP focuses on Confidentiality and BIBA focuses on Integrity. Source: P1:L6 MAC slides \| Other MAC models

Examples of BLP model classfications are High, Medium, and Low.

Answer False. Examples are Top Secret, Secret, Confidential. Source: P1:L6 MAC slides \| Other MAC models

Question: In a DBMS, what happens in the following scenario assuming each of these steps are followed sequentially? Assume the grant option is always used.

* Ann grants access right to Bob.
* Ann grants access right to Chris.
* Bob grants access right to David.
* David grants access right to Ellen.
* Chris grants access right to David.
* David grants access right to Frank.
* Ellen grants access right to Jim.
* Bob revokes access right from David.
* A.David no longer has the access right.
* B. David, Ellen, Frank, and Jim no longer have the access right.
* C. David, Ellen, and Jim no longer have the access right.
* D. Ellen and Jim no longer have the access right.

Answer D. In most implementations, the revocation is cascaded. In this case, since Chris also granted access to David, then David won't have his access revoked, but Ellen since her access was granted after Bob \(and before Chris\) had granted access to David. Frank's access remains since David granted access to him after Chris granted access to David. In general terms, if the access right would exist anyway, then the revoke is not cascaded.

Answer d\) Assurance Source: Book p.68

Question: In the areas of Risk assurance levels are classified on a system of numbers 1 through 4. Pick the appropriate option which describes these risks accordingly:

* A.\) Assurance Level of 1 tells us that users level is appropriate to access restricted services of very high value, Level 2 let's users access documents and services which are of a high a value but no the highest, Level 3 is where the secure authentication protocol is needed so we know who is accessing what, Level 4 there is little to no authentication at this level there is o confidence in the asserted identity's validity.
* B.\) Assurance Level 1-4 are all the same they all have some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. The main thing is that each level is based on the user's username for their organization.
* C.\) Level 1 typical authentication is a user supplied ID and there isn't much confidence in the users identity. Level 2 there is some confidence this is typically the level where an authentication protocol is devised for users, Level 3 is a high confidence but not the highest level at this level we have access to some sensitive documents and programs and at Level 4 you have the highest confidence and the highest access.
* D.\) None of the above
