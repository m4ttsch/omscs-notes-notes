# OMSCS Lecture Notes

This repository contains lecture notes for the classes I am taking or have taken in OMSCS.

Each set of notes for a particular class will live in a subdirectory of the repository root. In each subdirectory, the notes are presented in Markdown format.

If you prefer, you can also view the notes on [OMSCS Notes](https://www.omscs-notes.com).

If you notice any grammatical errors or flagrantly confusing sentences, please open a PR and point them out. I proofread my notes after taking them, but mistakes do slip through.

### Thank you and happy studying!
