# 1.2 Introduction to CS6750

This is a high-level overview of the contents and structure of the class.

## Learning goals

Learning goals are things you should understand by the end of the course. There are three major learning goals in this course.

1. Understand the common principles in HCI.
   - The tried and true rules for designing good interactions between humans and computers.
2. Understand the design lifecycle.
   - concept -> prototype -> evaluation.
   - Understand this as an interative process.
3. Understand current applications of HCI.
   - Where is HCI being applied and where can it be applied? There are many applications, HCI is everywhere.

## Learning outcomes

**Learning goals vs. learning outcomes:** A learning goal is something you should know, a learning outcome is something you should be able to do.

This course has one learning outcome -

> To design effective interactions between humans and computers.

Let's break this statement down into its components

- design
- effective interactions
- humans and computers

### Design

We think of design in two ways

1. Apply known principles to a new problem
   - Giving users the right kind of feedback at the right time. Maybe a button changes color when you click it or something.
2. Iterative process of needfinding, prototyping, evaluating, and revising.
   - Ask users how they perform a task (needfinding), develop multiple solutions (prototyping), give the solutions to users to evaluate (evaluation), and then use the feedback from the users to build something better (revising).

These two things are a majority of the material that we'll cover in the course.

- Unit 2 is about HCI principles.
  - These principles come from human factors engineering and HCI research.
- Unit 3 is about HCI methods.
  - Gathering requirements, developing designs, evaluating new interfaces.

### Effective interactions

What does it mean for an interaction to be effective? **Effectiveness is defined in terms of our goal**.

Here are 3 different goals we might have.

1. Usability
   - This is often the goal. We want to make it easy for users to complete their task. Make it easy to change the termperature on a thermostat.
2. Research
   - Maybe we want to see how people respond when thermostats are hard to read. Design the interaction to help research goals.
3. Change
   - Maybe we want to change people's behavior, like reducing their carbon footprint. We can design the thermostat to encourage this.

### Between humans and computers

The human has some goal they want to accomplish. We aren't trying to design an effective interface, we are trying to make the accomplishment of the task easier by any means necessary.

If you set out to design a better thermostat you might get a thermostat that is easier to read. If you set out to design a better way to control the temperature, you might end up with something like [nest thermostat ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest_Thermostat) which learns from your usage patterns and starts to automatically set the temperature.

## Learning strategies, video material

Learning strategies are the ways that the course teaches you. Here are 3 strategies used in the video materials from the course.

1. Learning by example
   - There are examples that are used repeatedly in this course
2. Learning by doing
   - Throughout the course we are asked to design interactions
3. Learn by reflection
   - We are asked to stop and think about how the course material relates to our own life
   - We are not our user and using our own experiences can mislead us. Joyner tries to take us out of our comfort zone so we can see the tasks differently.

## Learning strategies, course at GA Tech

We can learn a lot from our classmates, academics have words for this -

- [peer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning)
- [collaborative learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_learning)
- [learning by teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching)
- [communities of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)

Also, this entire course is built around the idea of **project-based learning**.

Early in the semester we will form a team and start looking at a problem. We will use this problem to explore the ideas of HCI. By the end of the semester we might even be able to take this project and turn it into a research project or a real product.

## Learning assessments

To recap some previous sections -

- **Learning goals:** what we understand
- **Learning outcomes:** what we are able to do

We now introduce the learning assessment.

- **Learning assessment:** How we evaluate if we are meeting the learning goals and learning outcomes.
  - Do we know what we should know, can we do what we should be able to do.

Assessments primarily are to **design effective interactions between humans and computers**.

It starts with small tasks like recommending solutions for existing interfaces, then it works its way up to larger tasks like making prototypes with a team and evaluating a full solution.

In the end we are evaluated not just by our design, but also on the process we used to generate it.

## Course structure

Course lessons are designed to be independent, you should be able to skip around, but there is a reason why it is ordered the way it is.

We talked about how research informs design, and how design informs research. Remember this?

![](https://assets.omscs.io/secure-computer-systems/1.1-1.3/research_design.png)

We start by talking about established design principles, then we talk about how to do research, then we look at what is going on in the HCI community at large.

## 5 tips for doing well

1. Look over the assignments early
   - Some assignments require advance coordination. _From note taker: I had to drop this course once because I did not start an assignment early enough!_
2. Start the assignments early
   - Gives you time to get inspiration
3. Participate, interact with classmates.
4. Select an application area to explore.
5. Leave behind what you know.
   - You can't learn what you think you already know.
