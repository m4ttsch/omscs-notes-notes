# 1.3 Exploring HCI

In this section we group application areas into three categories.

1. Technologies
   - Emerging technological capabilities that let us create new and interesting user interactions.
2. Domains
   - Preexisting areas that could be significantly disrupted by computer interfaces like healthcare and education.
3. Ideas
   - Theories about the way people interact with interfaces and the world around them.

These groupings are somewhat arbitrary, there is a lot of overlap, but we group application areas together to organize this discussion.

## Technology: Virtual Reality

Virtual reality is an immersive computer-simulated reality, it is a newer technology. Most applications today are in the form of a [virtual reality headset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset).

Mostly it is used for video gammes, but there are other application areas.

- Tourism
- Commerce
- Art
- Education
- Psychology
  - VR is used for exposure therapy, people are even [selling this as a product](https://www.therapylab.com/face-your-fears).

## Technology: Augmented Reality

Virtual reality substitutes reality entirely. Augmented reality adds onto what is already in the real world. Maybe it shows you the path to take while you are driving.

Imagine systems that could automatically

- translate text or speech from a foreign language
- show reviews for a restaurant as you walk down the street
- include information about historical buildings or museum exhibits

This involves putting cameras everywhere, raising security concerns. We discuss interfaces and politics in unit 2.

## Technology: UbiComp and Wearables

**Ubiquitous computing** (also called pervasive computing) refers to the trend towards embedding computers in more and more everyday objects. It is related to the [internet of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things).

We build smart devices like refrigerators that can track their own contents or cars that can drive themselves.

Smart watches, smart glasses, advanced hearing aids, and robotic prosthetic limbs, are examples of wearable technology. These areas used to be reserved for human factors engineering, but now they are in the domain of HCI because there are computers in them.

## Technology: Robotics

The first conference on human-robot interaction took place in 2006 in Salt Lake City, several similar conferences have been created since then.

There are several questions we need to answer about human-robot interaction.

Here are some questions that are more philosophical.

- How do we ensure robots don't harm humans through faulty reasoning?
- How do we integrate robots into our social lives, or do we even need to?
- As robots are capable of more and more, how do we deal with the loss of demand for human work?

Here are some questions that are more concrete.

- How do we effectively interact with robots using voice and touch?
- How do we provide feedback to humans so they know that their input is being properly received and understood?
- How can we support humans in teaching things to robots, instead of just programming them?
  - Alternatively, can we create robots that teach things to humans?

## Technology: Mobile

Mobile computing is things like smartphones. We live in a mobile-first world.

Design challenges -

- Screen real-estate is limited
- Input methods are less precise
- User is distracted

Opportunities

- People have their phone with them all the time
- Support for experiences from navigation to star-gazing.

Related to fields like context aware computing, ubiquitous computing, and augmented reality.

Smart phones are good at some things, bad at others.

- Good at social networking, personal organization, games.
- Bad at writing essays, or programming.

What can we do to make the smart phone a full replacement for a desktop computer or laptop?

## Ideas: Context-sensitive computing

> David: What time is it?

> Amanda: You can go ahead and go to lunch.

This conversation doesn't make sense unless you can fill in the context. Maybe a while ago David asked what time they were breaking for lunch and Amanda had that context.

Context-sensitive computing attempts to give
computer interfaces contextual knowledge. Imagine if your smartphone stopped you from watching YouTube while you are driving, or brought up Google maps once you got in your car.

## Ideas: Gesture-based interaction

In the course videos, Joyner makes a lot of gestures.

These gestures help him emphasize points. Wouldn't it be great if computers could understand gestures?

Maybe some day you will be able type just by moving your fingers around in the air.

## Ideas: Pen and touch-based interaction

Computers often now have touch screens. A challenge can be lack of precision, but we can make up for this by using a pen that can touch the screen more precisely than our fingers.

Pen and touch-based interaction is very common in digital art. It is also used in education to write down mathematics to a display.

## Ideas: Information Visualization

We can communicate insights about data using data visualization. You could just draw a data visualization, but it is much easier and can potentially be interactive on a computer. Do you really want to draw [this](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/us_incomebrackets_by_state_facet.html)?

A good interface matches the user's **mental model** of the task at hand. A good visualization gives the viewer a good mental model of the reality represented by the data.

## Ideas: Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)

How do we use computers to support people working together online?

Researchers break CSCW down into two dimensions, **time and space** -

This course is happening in a different time and a different space. Instant messaging apps like Slack are different place same time, mimicking the real-time office experience.

In the course lectures there are multiple computers

- Amanda is running a camera
- Ben is running a teleprompter
- David is speaking

So this is collaborative work that is supported by computers, even though everybody is in the same room.

## Ideas: Social computing

Social computing is the part of HCI that's interested in the ways we socialize. For example, emojis let the same sentence take on different meanings.

> Well, wasn't that hilarious? üòÇüòú

> Well, wasn't that hilarious? üò§üò†

> Well, wasn't that hilarious? üòêüò¥

Social computing is interested in all areas where computing intersects with our social lives, including -

- Online gaming
- Wikipedia
- Dating websites

Social computing is interested in all areas where computing intersects with our social lives.

## Domain: Special needs

Computing can help us compensate for disabilities, injuries, aging.

- Prosthetic limbs
  - Part engineering, part neuroscience, part HCI.
  - HCI part is - how is the person going to use the limb on tasks they need to perform?
- Data sonification to communicate data to the blind
  - [Bruce Walker](http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/~walkerb/) of GA Tech has a lab doing this
- Virtual reality for people with some form of paralysis.
- Autonomous context-aware wheelchairs.

Some projects only impact a few people, but the impact to those people is large.

## Domain: Education

Your professor, David Joyner, teaches educational technology at Georgia Tech. Educational technology is often straightforward HCI, but there are some unique aspects.

- Maybe things shouldn't be easy
- Maybe if things are difficult it is a more valuable learning experience.
- Make sure the difficulty is about the concepts, not the interface.

## Domain: Healthcare

Lots of efforts in healthcare are about processing lots of data, but that data needs to eventually be useful to an actual person. Here are some ideas -

- Give doctors tools to evaluate and compare different diagnoses.
- Give patients the tools to monitor their own health and treatment options.
- Maybe it's context aware computing to ensure that patients drink enough water.
- Virtual reality exposure therapy

More ideas in the personal health space

- Fitbit for exercise monitoring
- MyFitnessPal for tracking diet
- Virtual reality exercise programs

Computers are everywhere in every hospital, so there are lots of opportunities generally.

## Domain: Security

If it is too hard to practice good security, people might ignore security best practices. If security isn't usable, people won't use it.

- [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) changed from v2 to v3 to be less burdensome on the user.
  - Instead of taking a test to determine if you are a human, it just analyzes mouse movements and you click a single button.
- HCI can also communicate why a security practice is necessary, helping to convince users to actually implement this.
  - Example: A game that ranks your password security against other users on a system.

## Domain: Games

In a video game the player should feel like they are actually in the world they are playing in. Video games use feedback cycles constantly.

Bad reviews of video games are often about the game having bad HCI. The controls are too hard to use, it's too hard to figure out what you are supposed to do. These are criticisms of the interface.

In gaming though there's such a tight connection between the task and the interface. Frustrations with a task can help us quickly identify problems with the interface.

## Reflections: Exploring HCI

We have just discussed several areas within HCI. Pick an area and keep it in mind throughout the course. Hopefully you can apply what you learn in this class to the area you are interested in.
