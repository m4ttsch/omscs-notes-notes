# Relational Algebra and Calculus

## Closed Algebra

Let's talk about closed algebra. Consider the following expression containing
rational numbers:

$$
(((7*(5+3) - 21) *3) / (10 + 5)) * 3
$$

Even if we can't discern the result by looking at the expression, we know the
steps required to compute the result based on the rules governing the order of
operations.

We call this algebra **closed** because each expression involving rational
numbers evaluates to a rational number, resolving to the same type of data as we
input. A closed algebra allows you to formulate high-level models and use
previous thoughts to form new ones. In the expression above, we build up
intermediate results from the initial operands until we finally arrive at one
value.

## Relational Algebra Operations

Let's look at a collection of relational algebra operators involving two
relations, $R$, and $S$. First, we have four set operators:

- The set union operator, $R \cup S$
- The set intersection operator, $R \cap S$
- The set difference operator, $R \setminus S$
- The Cartesian product operator, $R \times S$

We use the **projection operator**, $\pi$, to eliminate attributes, or columns,
from a relation. For example, $\pi_{A_1, A_2, ..., A_n}(R)$ selects only those
attributes $A_1, A_2, ... , A_n$ in $R$. We use the **selection operator**
$\sigma$, which eliminates rows. For example, $\sigma_{\text{expression}}(R)$
selects only those rows in $R$ for which $\text{expression}$ evaluates to true.

The third group of operators is the joins, which are constructor operations. We
have the natural join operator, $R * S$. We also have outer joins, of which
there are three types: right, left, and full. In this lesson, we look at left
outer joins, $\Join_{\text{L}}$. Finally, we have theta joins, $R \Join_\theta
S$.

In the last group of operators, we see the division operator, $R \div S$, and
the rename operator, $\rho$. Division in relational algebra provides
functionality similar to universal quantification in relational calculus. The
rename operator lets us rename relation attribute names so two relations can
have the same name for certain attributes and thus be joined on them.

> The symbol for the left outer join is not really $\Join_{\text{L}}$. It's the
> symbol shown in the lectures. Unfortunately, it's not in my character set in
> this environment, so I can't express it.

## Selection

The general syntax to select all the tuples from a relation, $R$, that satisfy
an expression is $\sigma_\text{expression}(R)$. For example, if we want to
retrieve all tuples in the `RegularUser` relation, we would say:

$$
\sigma(\text{RegularUser})
$$

If `RegularUser` has $n$ tuples, the resulting relation after running this query
will also have $n$ tuples in it because we haven't specified any condition to
eliminate tuples.

## Selection - Simple Expression

Let's look at the selection operator with a simple expression. Suppose we want
to find all regular users whose hometown is Atlanta. We can express that query
in relational algebra as:

$$
\sigma_{\text{HomeTown = 'Atlanta'}}(\text{RegularUser})
$$

We can form simple expressions in one of two ways: either we can compare two
attributes or an attribute to a constant. The comparison operators we have at
hand are $=$, $<$, $\leq$, $>$, $\geq$, and $\neq$.

In the `RegularUser` table, we now select all tuples with a value of 'Atlanta'
for the `HomeTown` attribute. Remember, when we perform a selection, we retain
the number of columns from the original relation in the selection result.

![Selecting all tuples in RegularUser where HomeTown equals
'Atlanta'.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221011212412.png)

## Selection - Composite Expression

Suppose we want to find all regular users with the same current city and
hometown or with a hometown of Atlanta. We can express this query as so:

$$
\sigma_{\text{CurrentCity=HomeTown OR HomeTown ='Atlanta'}}(\text{RegularUser})
$$

Notice that the result of this selection, shown below, includes users who have a
hometown in Atlanta and those whose hometown matches their current city. For
example, we see one user from Dallas who currently lives in Dallas and another
user from Austin who currently lives in Austin.

![Selecting all tuples in RegularUser where the current city equals the hometown
or the hometown is Atlanta.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221011212257.png)

We can form composite expressions by combining simple expressions.
**Conjunction**, expressed mathematically as $\land$, refers to 'AND'ing two
expressions, **disjunction**, $\lor$, refers to 'OR'ing them, and **negation**
refers to inverting the truthiness of an expression. Additionally, we can place
parenthesis around an expression, which gives us fine control over the order of
operations.

## Projection

Given a relation, $R$, and attributes, $A = \{ A_1, A_2,...,A_n \}$, where $A$
forms a subset of the attributes on $R$, we can project $A$ from $R$ like so:

$$
\pi_{A_1, A_2,...,A_n}(R)
$$

For example, suppose we want to retrieve just the email, birth year, and sex for
all regular users in Atlanta. We can express this query with the following
syntax:

$$
\pi_\text{Email, BirthYear, Sex}(\sigma_\text{HomeTown='Atlanta'})(\text{RegularUser})
$$

![Retrieving the email, birth year, and sex of users from
Atlanta.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221011214022.png)

This query demonstrates the power inherent in relational algebra being a closed
query language. First, we take the `RegularUser` relation and perform a
selection. From that intermediate result, *which we know must be a relation*, we
can then perform the projection. We can only express composed queries like this
when working with a closed algebra.

## Relations are Sets

Let's say we want to find the sex of regular users in Atlanta. We could specify
that query as:

$$
\pi_\text{Sex}((\sigma_\text{HomeTown='Atlanta'}\text{RegularUser}))
$$

In the `RegularUser` table, we have three users from Atlanta, so we have three
tuples that match our selection condition. Our projection, however, only shows
one "M" and one "F", despite the selection returning two females and one male.
In other words, relations are sets and, thus, do not contain duplicate tuples.

![Retrieving the sex of users from Atlanta. Notice the lack of duplicate
values.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221011214342.png)

## Intersection

The second set-based operator is the intersection operator: $\cap$. For example,
consider the set of cities that are hometowns and the set that are current
cities for regular users. We can find the elements that those sets share with
the following query:

$$
\pi_\text{CurrentCity}(\text{RegularUser}) \cap\pi_\text{HomeTown}(\text{RegularUser})
$$

In the `RegularUser` relation, we see Dallas and San Francisco appear in both
the `CurrentCity` and `HomeTown` columns, so those values constitute our result.

![The intersection of current cities and hometowns in the regular user
relation.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221012163018.png)

## Set Difference

The third set-based operator is the difference operator, $\setminus$. Suppose we
want to find the elements of the set of current cities that are not also
elements of the set of hometowns. Here's how we would formulate this query:

$$
\pi_\text{CurrentCity}(\text{RegularUser}) \setminus
\pi_\text{HomeTown}(\text{RegularUser})
$$

Of the cities in the `CurrentCity` column, only Dallas is in the `HomeTown`
column. Thus, we eliminate it from the result. Notice again that we drop
duplicate values; College Park appears as a current city twice in `RegularUser`,
but only once in the result.

![The set difference between current city and hometown in regular
user.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221012163435.png)

## Natural Join

Let's say we want to generate a relation that displays user and event
information for every year an event occurred and a user was born. Suppose we
have two relations: `RegularUser`, with attributes `Email`, `Year`, and `Sex`;
and `Major60sEvent`, with attributes `Year` and `Event`. We need to join the two
relations to answer this query, and we formalize this **natural join** as
follows:

$$
\text{RegularUser} * \text{Major60sEvents}
$$

![Joining RegularUser and Major60sEvents on
Year.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221012214045.png)

Notice that both `RegularUser` and `Major60sEvents` have a similarly named
attribute, `Year`. The natural join operation compares all combinations of
tuples from both relations and checks if the value of `Year` is the same.

If a tuple in either relation has a value of `Year` that is not present in the
other, then that tuple will be absent from the result. In the joined relation,
all attributes from the constituent relations are present, with the joined
attribute appearing once. If multiple tuples have matching attributes, we will
see one tuple in the join relation for each match.

Let's summarize some of the features of a natural join:

- It matches values of attributes with the same name and only those.
- It keeps only one copy of the join attribute in the result.
- We call a natural join an **inner join**because only the matching tuples
  appear in the result, with unmatched tuples eliminated.

## Theta Join

Next, we look at the **theta join**. Suppose we want to find the email, birth
year, sex, and event year when the birth year of the regular user occurs before
the year of the major 60s event. We can formalize this query as follows:

$$
\text{RegularUser}\Join_{\text{BirthYear < EventYear}} \text{Major60sEvents}
$$

In the result, we see one user born in 1967 predates four events, while another
user born in 1968 predates one. Notice that the resulting relation has five
rows, not two. Our result has a row for each user/event combination.

![Retrieving all users and the events that occurred after their
birth.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221012214918.png)

Let's compare the natural join with the theta join:

- A natural join can express only equality conditions, while a theta join can
  also express inequality conditions using the $<$, $\leq$, $>$, $\geq$, and
  $\neq$ operators.
- Two relations joined by a natural join must share an attribute name, while the
  theta join does not have this restriction.
- In the natural join, the join attribute appears once in the result. Both
  attributes in a theta join appear in the relation (`BirthYear` and `EventYear`
  above).

Like a natural join, a theta join preserves all attributes from the joined
relations in the result. The theta join is also an inner join because tuples in
the two relations that do not match each other do not appear in the result.

## Left Outer Join

The third constructor operator we examine is the **outer join operator**,
specifically the **left outer join**, whose operator is $\Join_{\text{L}}$.
Suppose we want to perform the natural join we saw above and retain unmatched
tuples from `RegularUser`. The algebra expression is:

$$
\text{RegularUser} \Join_{\text{L}} \text{Major60sEvents}
$$

![An outer join. Notice how all users are present, and those unmatched users
have NULL in the event column](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221012221326.png)

For every user whose birth year matches the event year, we include a tuple for
every match. Two users' birth years don't match any event year in the events
table. We said we want to retain their information, and we can include it, but
we must fill in the absent event information with `NULL` values. That `NULL`
corresponds to the "outer" part of the result.

The resulting relation is a superset of the result of the natural join we
expressed earlier. In this case, the left outer join we saw here is a natural
left outer join - a special case of the natural join - because we compared
attributes of the same name.

## Cartesian Product: X

The fourth constructor operator in the relational algebra is the **Cartesian
product** operator, $\times$. A Cartesian product, $A \times B$, results in a
relation with $N * M$ tuples, where $N$ is the number of tuples in $A$, and $M$
is the number of tuples in $B$. For example, we can combine every tuple in
`RegularUser` with every tuple in `UserInterests`:

$$
\text{RegularUser} \times \text{UserInterests}
$$

![Every user matched with every interest: a Cartesian
product.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221012222005.png)

There are no comparison rules in the Cartesian product - in contrast to the
other joins - to selectively include only certain matches in the result. Here,
we combine everything. Why might that be useful?

## Cartesian Product: Can be Useful

Suppose we have a `RegularUser` relation and a `UserInterests` relation. The
`UserInterests` table contains information about users' interests and has a
foreign key, `Email`, that references the primary key in `RegularUser`. We want
to find all the hobbies in which each user has *not* expressed interest.

First, we project `RegularUser` onto `Email` and `UserInterests` onto `Interest`
so that we have one relation containing just user emails and another with just
user interests. Now, we compute the Cartesian product of the two results, which
creates a tuple for each user for each interest. Finally, we subtract from this
result `UserInterests` to eliminate the interests we already recorded. We
express this query as:

$$
(\pi_\text{Email}(\text{RegularUser}) \times
\pi_\text{Interest}(\text{UserInterests})) \setminus (\pi_\text{Email,
Interest}(\text{UserInterests}))
$$

Notice that the two operands in the set difference are compatible. The resulting
relation from the Cartesian product operation has `Email` and `Interest`
attributes, and from that, we subtract the projection of `UserInterests` onto
`Email` and `Interest` (dropping `Since Age`).

Here is the result. Let's look at user one, for example. In `UserInterests`,
this user has music as an interest but not blogging or meditation. We see those
two hobbies associated with this user in the result.

![Retrieving all interests not associated with each
user.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221013154420.png)

## Divide By

Now let's look at the divide by algebra operator: $\div$. This operator plays
the same role in relational algebra as universal quantification in relational
calculus. Suppose we want to find the email of all users with at least all the
interests of user one.

![Find the email of all users with at least all the interests of user
one.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221013155331.png)

User one has three interests: music, reading, and tennis. User one has at least
as many interests as user one, so we include them in the result. User three has
all of the interests of user one plus more, so we include them in the result
too. Neither user two nor user four have at least the set of interests that user
one has, so they are absent from the result.

Here's how we perform the divide-by operation. First, we calculate the divisor
by projecting `UserInterest` onto `Email` and `Interest`. Then, we calculate the
dividend by selecting user one's interests from `UserInterest` and then
projecting that relation onto `Interest`. The result is a single-column relation
containing music, reading, and tennis. We can express this query in the algebra
like so:

$$
\pi_{\text{Email,
Interest}}\text{UserInterests}\div\pi_{\text{Interest}}(\sigma_{\text{Email='user1@gt.edu'}}(\text{UserInterests}))
$$

When we divide one relation by another, the divisor has attributes $A$ and $B$,
the dividend has attribute $B$, and the result has attribute $A$. We divide
$\text{Email, Interest}$ by ${\text{Interest}}$ to produce $\text{Email}$ here.
The divide by operation always follows this structure.

Here is formal definition of the result where $\text{R}$ is the `RegularUser`
relation, $\text{S}$ is the intermediate projection of user one's interests,
$\text{E}$ is short for "Email" and $\text{I}$ is short for "Interest":

$$
\text{R(E,I)} \div \text{S(I)} = \{ \text{r.E |} \text{r} \in \text{R and }
\forall(\text{s}\in\text{S})\exists(\text{t}\in\text{R})(\text{t.E=r.E and
t.I=s.I}) \}
$$

What this formalism describes is the following. Let's look at each candidate
tuple $\text{r}$ in relation $\text{R}$. For all ($\forall$) tuples $\text{s}$
in relation $\text{S}$, if there exists ($\exists$) a tuple $\text{t}$ in
$\text{R}$ such that $\text{t}$ and $\text{r}$ have the same email and
$\text{t}$ and $\text{s}$ have the same interest, then include $\text{r.Email}$
in the result.

## Rename

The last algebraic operator we examine is the rename operator, $\rho$. Renaming
attributes and relations is useful when we want to perform various types of
joins. Here is the basic syntax:

$$
\rho_{\text{New Relation Name}[\text{New Name Old Name, New Name Old Name,
...}]}(\text{Old Relation Name})
$$

For example, we can rename the `RegularUser` relation to `RUser`, the
`BirthYear` attribute to `Year`, and the `Sex` attribute to `Gender`:

$$
\rho_{\text{RUser}[\text{Year Birth Year, Gender Sex}]}(\text{Old Relation
Name})
$$

![Renaming relations and
attributes.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221012184357.png)

## Relational Calculus

Relational algebra is procedural; we combine operators to describe the steps we
must take to produce the desired result. For instance, we might say join two
relations, project the result, and then select from that result to get the final
relation. **Relational calculus** is declarative. Instead of describing steps,
we describe the result we want. Relational tuple calculus forms the basis of
SQL.

> it turns out, both can be shown to be equivalent regarding data retrieval
> "horsepower", as Professor Mark calls it.

## Relational Calculus Expressions

Let's look at expressions in **relational calculus** - specifically **relational
tuple calculus**, so named because queries have variables that range over sets
of tuples. Here's a query:

$$
\text{\{t | P(t)\}}
$$

This query returns the set of tuples $\text{t}$ that satisfy the predicate
$\text{P}$. Predicates consist of **atoms**, so let's first define the atoms in
this calculus.

The first atom is the **range expression**. For example, $\text{t} \in
\text{R}$, and $\text{R(t)}$ denote that $t$ is a tuple of relation $R$. The
second atom compares two tuple attributes. We reference tuple attributes as
follows: $\text{t.A}$ denotes the value of attribute $\text{A}$ on tuple
$\text{t}$. The third atom compares a tuple attribute to a constant, $\text{c}$.
We use $\theta$ to denote comparison operators, which consist of $<$, $\leq$,
$>$, $\geq$, and $\neq$.

In summary, atoms are one of the following:

- A range expression: $\text{t}\in \text{R}$
- A comparison of two attributes: $\text{r.A } \theta \text{ s.B}$
- A comparison of one attribute and a constant: $\text{r.A } \theta \text{ c}$.

An atom is a predicate. Furthermore, given atoms $\text{P}_1$ and $\text{P}_2$,
the following expressions are also predicates: $(\text{P}_1)$, $\text{not P}_1$,
$\text{P}_1 \text{ or } \text{P}_2$, $\text{P}_1 \text{ and } \text{P}_2$, and
$\text{P}_1 \implies \text{P}_2$, where $\implies$ means "implies".

Finally, if $\text{P(t)}$ is a predicate and ${\text{t}}$ is a free variable in
$\text{R}$, and $\text{R}$ is a relation, then "there exists a $\text{t}$ in
$\text{R}$ that satisfies $\text{P}$" is a predicate called the **existential
quantifier**: $\exists (t\in R)(P(t))$. Likewise, "for all $\text{t}$ in
$\text{R}$ for which $\text{P(t)}$ is true" a predicate called the **universal
quantifier**: $\forall \text{(t } \in \text{R)(P(t))}$. If $\text{t}$ is free in
the predicate $\text{P}$, then using the existential quantifier or the universal
quantifier binds $\text{t}$.

## Calculus - Selection

For the rest of the lectures in this section, we will revisit the queries we saw
in the relational algebra section and express them using relational tuple
calculus. Here is the corresponding tuple calculus expression for selecting all
regular users:

$$
\text{\{r | r } \in \text{ RegularUser\}}
$$

We can think of this query as: find the set $\text{r}$ where $\text{r}$ is a
member of the relation $\text{ RegularUser\}}$. As we might expect, this
relation is identical to $\text{ RegularUser}$.

![Selecting all regular users using relational tuple
calculus](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221013181148.png)

## Calculus - Selection: Composite Expression

Let's find all regular users who have the same current city and hometown or have
a hometown of Atlanta:

$$
\text{\{r | r } \in \text{ RegularUser and (r.CurrentCity=r.HomeTown} \\
\text{or r.HomeTown='Atlanta')\}}
$$

![Using relational calculus to select regular users who have the same current
city and hometown or whose hometown is
Atlanta.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221013182305.png)

Notice that even if we had another relation with the attributes `CurrentCity`
and `HomeTown` with similar values, those tuples would be absent from the result
because they did not come from $\text{RegularUser}$. All expressions in the
selection query must be true for a tuple to appear in the result.

## Calculus - Projection

Suppose we want to find the email, birth year, and sex for all regular users
whose hometown is Atlanta. Here is that query:

$$
\text{\{r.Email, r.BirthYear, r.Sex | r } \in \text{ RegularUser and} \\
\text{ (r.CurrentCity=r.HomeTown or r.HomeTown='Atlanta')\}}
$$

We can see below that the resulting relation consists of only the requested
attributes for the tuples that match the selection query.

![A calculus expression to find the email, birth year, and sex for all regular
users whose hometown is
Atlanta.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221013183056.png)

## Calculus - Union

Let's find all cities that are either a current city or a hometown for a regular
user.

$$
\text{\{s.City | } \exists \text{(r}\in \text{
RegularUser)(s.City=r.CurrentCity) or} \\ \exists \text{(t}\in \text{
RegularUser)(s.City=t.HomeTown)}\}
$$

If a tuple exists in $\text{RegularUser}$ with a current city, then that city is
part of the result. Similarly, if a tuple exists in $\text{RegularUser}$ with a
hometown, then that city is part of the result.

![A union expression in relational calculus that retrieves all cities that are
either a hometown or a current
city.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221013183636.png)

## Calculus - Intersection

Let's find all cities that are a current city for some regular user and a
hometown for some regular user.

$$
\text{\{s.City | } \exists \text{(r}\in \text{
RegularUser)(s.City=r.CurrentCity) and} \\ \exists \text{(t}\in \text{
RegularUser)(s.City=t.HomeTown)}\}
$$

For a tuple $\text{s}$ to qualify, there must exist a tuple $\text{r}$ in
$\text{Regular User}$ that has the same city as $\text{s}$, and it must also be
the case that there is a tuple $\text{t}$ that has the same hometown as
$\text{s}$. We retrieve the $\text{City}$ attribute for qualifying tuples.

![An intersection expression in relational calculus that retrieves all cities
that are both a hometown and a current
city.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221014145645.png)

## Calculus - Set Difference

Suppose we want to find the elements of the set of current cities that are not
also elements of the set of hometowns. Here's how we would formulate this query:

$$
\text{\{s.City | } \exists \text{(r}\in \text{
RegularUser)(s.City=r.CurrentCity) and not} \\ \exists \text{(t}\in \text{
RegularUser)(s.City=t.HomeTown)}\}
$$

For a tuple $\text{s}$ to qualify, there must exist a tuple $\text{r}$ in
$\text{Regular User}$ that has the same city as $\text{s}$, and it must also be
the case that there is *not* a tuple $\text{t}$ that has the same hometown as
$\text{s}$. We retrieve the $\text{City}$ attribute for qualifying tuples.

![An set minus expression in relational calculus that retrieves all cities that
are only a current city and not a
hometown.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221014150523.png)

## Calculus - Natural Join

Let's say we want to generate a relation that displays user and event
information for every year an event occurred and a user was born. Suppose we
have two relations: $\text{RegularUser}$, with attributes $\text{Email}$,
$\text{Year}$, and $\text{Sex}$; and $\text{Major60sEvent}$, with attributes
$\text{Year}$ and $\text{Event}$. We need to join the two relations to answer
this query, and we formalize this natural join as follows:

$$
\{\text{t.Email, t.Year, t.Sex, t.Event | } \exists (\text{r} \in
\text{RegularUser}) \exists (\text{s} \in \text{Major60sEvents)}\\\text{(r.Year
= s.Year and t.Email = r.Email and t.Year = r.Year and t.Sex = r.Sex} \\ \text{
and t.Event = s.Event)}\}
$$

![Using a natural join in relational calculus to join users to events that
occurred the same year they were
born.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221015105839.png)

Let's decipher this query expression. We are interested in a tuple, $\text{t}$
that contains $\text{Email}$, $\text{Year}$, $\text{Sex}$, and $\text{Event}$
attributes. What must be true for us to include $\text{t}$ in the result? Well,
there must exist a tuple $\text{r}$ in $\text{RegularUser}$ and a tuple
$\text{s}$ in $\text{Major60sEvent}$. If $\text{r.Year}$ equals $\text{s.Year}$,
then we pick $\text{r.Email}$, $\text{r.Year}$, $\text{r.Sex}$, and
$\text{s.Event}$ into $\text{t}$ and include it in the result.

## Calculus - Cartesian Product

Let's say we want to combine every tuple in the $\text{RegularUser}$ relation
with every tuple in the $\text{UserInterests}$ relation. We can express that
Cartesian product in relational calculus like so:

$$
\text{\{r, s | r} \in \text{RegularUser and s}\in\text{UserInterests}\}
$$

![Using the Cartesian product to combine every tuple in RegularUser with every
tuple in UserInterests.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221014150954.png)

## Calculus - Cartesian Product: Can be useful

Suppose we have a $\text{RegularUser}$ relation and a $\text{UserInterests}$
relation. The $\text{UserInterests}$ table contains information about users'
interests and has a foreign key, $\text{Email}$, that references the primary key
in $\text{RegularUser}$. We want to find all the hobbies in which each user has
*not* expressed interest. Here is how we express this query:

$$
\text{\{r.Email, s.Interest | r} \in \text{RegularUser and
s}\in\text{UserInterests and} \\ \text{not(}\exists\text{(t}\in
\text{UserInterests)(r.Email = t.Email and s.Interest = t.Interest))}\}
$$

![Using negation and Cartesian product to select the hobbies in which each user
has not expressed interest.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221016132718.png)

We are looking for a tuple, $\text{r}$, from $\text{RegularUser}$ and a tuple,
$\text{s}$, from $\text{UserInterests}$ where it is *not* the case that there
exists a tuple, $\text{t}$, from $\text{UserInterests}$ that has the same
$\text{Email}$ as $\text{r}$ or the same $\text{Interest}$ as $\text{s}$. We
then select $\text{r.Email}$ and $\text{s.Interest}$ for those tuples $\text{r}$
and $\text{s}$ for which this predicate is true.

## Calculus - Divide By

Suppose we want to find the email of all users with at least all the interests
of user one. Here is how we express that query in relational calculus:

$$
\{\text{r.Email | r } \in \text{UserInterests and } \forall
\text{(s}\in\text{UserInterests)}\text{((s.Email}\neq\text{'user1@gt.edu') or }
\\ \exists\text{(t}\in \text{UserInterests)(r.Email = t.Email and t.Interest =
s.Interest))}\}
$$

![Using universal quantification to select the email address of users that share
at least all of user one's
interests.](https://assets.omscs.io/notes/20221016134441.png)

We are interested in values of the $\text{Email}$ attribute on tuples $\text{r}$
from the $\text{UserInterests}$ relation. For a candidate $\text{r}$ tuple, we
must check that something is true for every tuple $\text{s}$ in
$\text{UserInterests}$. Either the value of the $\text{Email}$ attribute for
$\text{s}$ must not be user one's email address, or, if it is, then the
following must be true: there must exist a tuple $\text{t}$ in
$\text{UserInterests}$ that shares an email with $\text{r}$ and an interest with
$\text{t}$.
