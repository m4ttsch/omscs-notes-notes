# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took ML4T in OMSCS during Spring 2020.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud501). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit any introductory or summary videos.

## Textbook Information

The following textbooks helped me get an **A** in this course:

* [Python for Finance: Analyze Big Financial Data](https://amzn.to/3gm1l0H)
* [What Hedge Funds Really Do: An Introduction to Portfolio Management](https://amzn.to/3cXFLgK)
* [Machine Learning](https://amzn.to/36sMbSv)

## Download These Notes

Some students have asked for PDF versions of the notes for a simpler, more portable studying experience. The following PDFs are available for download.

* [Machine Learning for Trading - Complete](https://payhip.com/b/h5Pv)

## Environment Setup

This class requires some environment setup. I have recorded the following YouTube walkthroughs, which may be helpful:

* [Accessing Buffet Servers and Moving Code with Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcAZ1qn4lGo)
