# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes for Simulation, which I am taking in Fall 2020.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a module in Canvas. Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that module. Usually, I omit any introductory, summary, or administrative content.

## Textbook Information

The following textbooks helped me get an **A** in this course:

* [Simulation Modeling and Analysis](https://amzn.to/3au4zN5)
* [Simulation with Arena](https://amzn.to/2E4zTWo)
